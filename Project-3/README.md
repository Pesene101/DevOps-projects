## Documentation For AWS LAMP STACK IMPLEMENTATION
# This Project shows how to implement LAMP(Linux,Apache,Mysql,PhP) Stack on AWS

A LAMP stack is a bundle of four different software technologies that developers use to build websites and web applications. LAMP is an acronym for the operating system, Linux; the web server, Apache; the database server, MySQL; and the programming language, PHP.

    Linux: The operating system. Linux is a free and open source operating system (OS) that has been around since the mid-1990s. Today, it has an extensive worldwide user base that extends across industries. Linux is popular in part because it offers more flexibility and configuration options than some other operating systems.

    Apache: The web server. The Apache web server processes requests and serves up web assets via HTTP so that the application is accessible to anyone in the public domain over a simple web URL. Developed and maintained by an open community, Apache is a mature, feature-rich server that runs a large share of the websites currently on the internet. 

    MySQL: The database. MySQL is an open source relational database management system for storing application data. With My SQL, you can store all your information in a format that is easily queried with the SQL language. SQL is a great choice if you are dealing with a business domain that is well structured, and you want to translate that structure into the backend. MySQL is suitable for running even large and complex sites. See "SQL vs. NoSQL Databases: What's the Difference?" for more information on SQL and NoSQL databases.

    PHP: The programming language. The PHP open source scripting language works with Apache to help you create dynamic web pages. You cannot use HTML to perform dynamic processes such as pulling data out of a database. To provide this type of functionality, you simply drop PHP code into the parts of a page that you want to be dynamic. 

Follow the links below to install some dependencies before lunching the ubuntu virtual machine on your device.

- [Install OpenSSH](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse?tabs=powershell#tabpanel_1_powershell)

- [OpenSSH Key Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_keymanagement#user-key-generation)

By installing these dependencies, your device will be authenticated to have access to the server and github easily.

After launching the Ubuntu Virtual machine on AWS Account, install Apache2 using the Ubuntu package manager 'apt';

**`sudo apt update`**

**`sudo apt install apache2`**

To verify that apache2 is running as a server, use the following command;

**`sudo systemctl status apache2`**
